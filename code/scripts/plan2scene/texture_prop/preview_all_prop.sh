# Do not use this script to make the final inferences. All surfaces are predicted by the GNN (including observed surfaces).
# We simulate the predicted surface unobserved. Therefore, the GNN has to infer it using information from other observed surfaces.
# So, the performance is sub-par for observed surfaces. But, it should give a good idea about the capability of GNN to produce meaningful embeddings.
